<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p><strong> Division of an entire bacterial colony is the canonical example of exponential growth. However, the rate of growth of an individual bacterium is less obvious; complex cellular dynamics within the replication machinery and cytoskeletal reactions can change the density of the cell during division, and there could be multiple positive and negative feedback dependencies on the current size that act to promote or constrict growth. Here, two parent <em>Caulobacter Crescentus</em> cells undergoing division were studied, the data provided by <a href="http://schererlab.uchicago.edu/">Norbert Scherer's Lab</a> @ the University of Chicago. Ultimately, we observe a discernible pattern of exponential growth between divisions. We will discuss the specific image processing techniques used to extract the relevant data from these images, as well as the modeling methods used to reach our conclusion of exponential growth.</strong></p>
    
<h3 id="experimental methods">Experimental Methods</h3>
<p>The Scherer Lab developed a technique to switch off cell adhesion in <em>C. Crescentus</em>, allowing for low-density visualization that would prevent overcrowding in the field of view. Hundreds of generational divisions were studied with a microfluidic device, and the imaged data was subsequently made available to us via Justin Bois.</p>

<h2 id="img processing">Image Processing</h2>
<!--      MOVIES-->
<p> <strong>The modules in python's <code>skimage</code> helped us convert our images to a binary file, where pixels were either marked as part of the bacterium or not. To do this, a sobel filter was applied to help us define a threshold to assist us in segmentation. The source code is provided below, as well as a discussion of why we selected particular values and variables to help us in the conversion process.</strong></p>

    <h2 id="Segmentation">Segmentation Methodology</h2>
    <p> Since noise can cause one pixel to look very different from its neighbors, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marr%E2%80%93Hildreth_algorithm">Marr Hildreth algorithm</a> was used to apply a Sobel filter, utilizing a nice computation technique taking the log of the gaussian, operating under the principle that pixels along an edge share similar values.

    <h3><code>thresh</code>: threshold </h3>
    <p> A threshold was set manually determining a quantitative cut-off point for the divided  vs. undivided state. Biologically, we know that the bacteria drift from each other as soon as separation occurs, so we are looking for a threshold that will accurately capture that moment. Watching divisions frame-by-frame, we noticed the frame rate introduced a minor inconsistency during each division, since it most likely misses the instantaneous moment of actual division, and captures the division at different stages each round. This introduces the researcher's choice in deciding what actually qualifies as division. A threshold of 0.0045 was chosen after observing sobel mapping value behaviors around division frames. </p>
   
   <h3><code>selem</code>: structuring element size</h3>
   <p> This structuring element was defined for closing and thresholding purposes. Since we know the daughter cell gets flushed away as soon as it finishes dividing, the transformation of "closing" artificially joins the two bacteria. This is a semi-fix for the inter-frame division problem (we most likely do not observe the moment of instantaneous division). We watched the divisions frame-by-frame, viewing how the binary frames progressed, and we settled on a closing parameter that made sure the initial size of the next growth cycle could be as representative of 'instantaenous' as possible. We chose to make this value the same for both bacterium since it made sense that if both bacteria were both around the same size (i.e., ~2μm^2), and the camera apparatus remained the same, then having the same closing parameter would not introduce too much error. If we were aiming for more precision, with a lot more bacteria of differing sizes, we would scale the structuring element area proportionally with the bacteria's time-averaged size.</p>

        <h2 id="Segmentation">Segmentation Corrections</h2>
        <p><strong> After arriving at our binary image, we make the assumption that our bacteria is the second largest element in the array (the first being the background... the errors arising from this assumption are dealt with below). The pixels are then counted for each frame and the areas stored in a csv file. However, before doing so, we noticed when watching the divisions frame-by-frame, there were some segmentation errors. We discuss here how we treated the data: </strong> </p>
        <h3> <code>max_growth</code>: maximum growth rate between frames</h3>
        <p>A variable max_growth was defined to set a limitation on how much the bacteria could grow between frames (within one minute). When the edge-detection wasn't able to separate neighboring bacteria from the one of interest, it resulted in false data point spikes. This was a significant issue with the bacterium 2. We set this value manually to 0.025, which means a 2.5% growth rate per minute. Note that for all divisions, we observed with our human eyes no growth surpassed this rate within one frame—we are not eliminating frames to smooth plots, but rather to deal with the errors when the machine counts the areas.</p>
        
        <h3> <code>wiggle</code>: handles massive drops in area </h3>
       <p> This variable helps segment growth cycles with time by setting a lower bound on what constitutes as growth and what is simply due to thresholding fluctuations. We considered a drop greater than 200 - 250 pixels significant for these two bacteria. If we were to formalize these values, a function could be written to approximate average growth, and a bound 1-2 standard deviations away from the mean could be set. </p>
        <h3> <code>frames_away</code>: latency </h3>
        <p> This accounts for periods of latency where the bacteria is in the process of preparing for division, and not actually significantly growing. There is a hidden variable <code>growth</code> in the <code>plucking()</code> method; the product of these two values sets bounds on growth. If this variable is 2, and the area 4 frames away from the current frame is outside 8x in both directions, then the bacteria is not experiencing much growth and is peacefully floating about. </p>

<!--        Note: <code>wiggle</code> deals with larger time cycles, and <code>frames_away</code> deal with periods of latency.-->
