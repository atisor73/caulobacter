#### This repository is a home for our caulobacter data, code, figures, and analysis for BeBi103 Fall 2019 @Caltech. The team consists of Rosita Fu, Theresa Marlin, and Erika Salzman.

Future edits to the website will hopefully include successful html embedding of interactive plots and greater ease in the navigational structure of the page (less scrolling, more clicking).
