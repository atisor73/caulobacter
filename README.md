# Caulobacter Crescentus 
This repository is a home for our caulobacter data, code, figures, and analysis for BeBi103 Fall 2019 @Caltech. The website exists [here](atisor.github.io/CCTV). The team consists of Rosita Fu, Theresa Marlin, and Erika Salzman.

#### `datasets_csv`
This directory holds csv files of our tidied dataframes containing segmented areas along with separate dataframes containing their ROI's for each bacterium.

#### `figures`
All figures that appear on the website live in this directory in their original file format. The numbers correspond to the order in which they appear.

#### `caulobacterpkg`
Python files with all the functions we used to process and visualize the images, and plot and model our extracted data all live here.
